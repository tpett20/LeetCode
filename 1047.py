# 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String
# You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.
# We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.
