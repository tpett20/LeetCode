# 2696. Minimum String Length After Removing Substrings
# You are given a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters.
# You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove any occurrence of one of the substrings "AB" or "CD" from s.
# Return the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain.
# Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new "AB" or "CD" substrings.
